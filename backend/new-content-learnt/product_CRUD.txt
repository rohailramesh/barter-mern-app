1. Setup Product model
2. Create product routes and controllers
3. Add middlewares where needed
4. Add product api route to server.js


How next() is used in middlewares ->
Use case: Let admin create new user
1. First middleware is to check if user is logged in
2. Second middleware is to check if logged in user is admin
3. Create new user function is executed

So next() basically moves from one middleware to next and then to controller

eg: in admin.routes.js
router.post("/create-user", checkLoggedIn, checkAdminStatus, createUser)

so it first runs checkLoggedIn function then moves next to checkAdminStatus and then next to createUser
