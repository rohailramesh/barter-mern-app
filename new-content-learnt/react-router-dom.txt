Working with React Router
React-Router-Dom has different elements to use:
- Navigate
- BrowserRouter
- Routes
- Route
- Link
1. Wrap the entire app (main.jsx) with <BrowserRouter>
2. Add different routes within the <Routes> in App.jsx
Eg: 
<Routes>
    <Route path="/home" element={<HomePage/>}/>


Flow of routes and links
- Routes are set in App.jsx
- Links are created to navigate to a specific route within the routes
Eg in App.js:
<Routes>
    <Route path="/login" element={<LoginPage}/>
</Routes>


Eg in Navbar.js:
<Link to={"/login"}>Login</Link>

So when the user clicks on the "Login" link in the navbar, it will bring them to the /login route.
