Difference between <Navigate/> and {useNavigate} when redirecting user to specific page when a certain criteria is met.

Navigate is a react component that is used when conditional or automatic navigation is required.
For example if user is trying to access 'My Profile' page but they are not logged in, we can check that condition and automatically direct them to login/signup page.

<Route
    path='/secret-dashboard'
    element={user?.role === "admin" ? <AdminPage /> : <Navigate to='/login' />}
    />

Whereas, useNavigate is a hook that can be used to redirect a user when some kind of function or action is executed.
-import useNavigate
- create and instance of useNavigate
- use that instance in a function
Eg; when user fills in a form and clicks submit, on successful submission they can be navigated to a thankyou page.

const navigate = useNavigate();

const submitForm = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    navigate("/submission-success");
}
